    <h3 class="kk">So let's start with my sport carier</h3>
<p>I'm doing one sport regularly and i have two ther sports that I don't really do regularly. My main 
    sport is waterpolo what I'm doing 5 times a week. We are playing games with other tems with a judge, 
    so I'm pretty serious about waterpolo. Also have 2 other sport of what I don't have training and I'm not
    serious about them which is basketball and skiing. This two is more of a hobbie what I do with my friends 
    or my family.
